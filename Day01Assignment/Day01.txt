HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2:
HTTP 1.1:
1. It works on the textual format
2. There is a head of line bloocking  that blocks all the requests behind it until dosen't get all the resources
3. It uses requests resource inlining for use getting multiple pages
4. It compreses data by itself

HTTP 2:
1. It works on binary Protocol
2. It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for mulltiple requests
3. It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
4. It uses HPACK for data compression

Object and its internal representation in javascript:
Objects:
1. Objects are key: value pair
2. It can store any type of data type (Number,string, boolean)
3. Syntax:
            objectName = {Name:"Gowtham"}
4. Example: 
            var object = {
                name:"gowtham",
                age:27,
                year:1996
            }            
5. we can access the objects by key eg: object.Name = gowtham
6. we can access the objects by two ways,
    box method
    dot method
7. Dot method :
                It is the common method to access the objects
console.log(object.year); => 1996
console.lo(object.age); => 27

we can able to add an object by 
object.gender("Male") =>
        var object = {
             name:"gowtham",
                age:27,
                year:1996,
                gender:Male
        }
8. Box Method:
                It should be used in (For in loop)        
This loop dosen't have termination it will run continuously until the end of the object
Syntax:
        for (var Key in objectName){}
Example: 
        for ( var i in obj){
            console.log(object[i]);
        }
output:
gowtham
27
1996
male
